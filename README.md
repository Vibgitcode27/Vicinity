<h2>üêπ GoLang Setup:</h2>
*  The application backend is implemented in GoLang. We chose GoLang over Express and other languages due to its performance, concurrency support, and simplicity.
* Our GoLang backend utilizes Prisma as an ORM with CockroachDB as the database.
* To set up the GoLang backend code, located in the backend folder of the repository, you need to configure it with a database URL. This URL should point to a PostgreSQL cloud instance that supports Prisma, such as Neon, CockroachDB, ElephantSQL, etc.
* Currently, our GoLang backend routes can be accessed at: [http://ec2-35-154-46-106.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4000](http://ec2-35-154-46-106.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4000)

<h2>Amazon S3 Setup</h2>
* For image storage and retrieval, we are using Amazon S3.
* Setting up the necessary IAM roles.
* Setting up the necessary environment variables in the `.env.example` file.
* Currently, our Amazon S3 backend can be accessed at: [http://ec2-13-126-223-141.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4000](http://ec2-13-126-223-141.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:4000)
